# Day 2: Logistic Regression

While Linear Regression predicts numbers (like price or temperature), Logistic Regression is used for classification (predicting a category).
It’s the go-to algorithm when the answer you’re looking for is "Yes/No," "True/False," or "Spam/Not Spam."

## How it Works
Instead of drawing a straight line that goes off to infinity, Logistic Regression uses a mathematical function called the Sigmoid Function.
This function takes any input and "squashes" it into a value between 0 and 1. We then treat this value as a probability.
ex:If the output is 0.85, there is an 85% chance the item belongs to Class A.
