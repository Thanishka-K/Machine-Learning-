# Day 9: Introduction to Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

## The Concept
A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neurons in the human brain work.
It consists of layers of interconnected "neurons" that process data and learn complex patterns through a process called Backpropagation.

## The Structure
- Input Layer: Takes in the raw data (e.g., pixels of an image).
- Hidden Layers: Where the "magic" happens. These layers perform mathematical transformations to find hidden patterns.
- Output Layer: Provides the final prediction (e.g., "This is a cat").

* Weights and Biases: Each connection between neurons has a weight that determines its importance.
* Activation Function: Decides if a neuron should "fire" (be activated) or not (e.g., ReLU or Sigmoid).
* Loss Function: Measures how far off the prediction was from the actual result.
* Optimizer: Adjusts the weights to minimize the error (the most common is Adam or SGD).
