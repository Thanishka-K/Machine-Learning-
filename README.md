# Short notes on machine learning 
ML is a way to get computers to learn from patterns in data rather than following a fixed set of instructions. Instead of a programmer writing every single "if-then" rule, the computer looks at examples and builds its own logic to predict outcomes.

## => The Three Main Types
Supervised Learning: This is like learning with a guide. You provide the computer with "labeled" data (input and the correct answer). For example, showing it 1,000 emails marked as "spam" or "not spam" until it can tell the difference itself.

Unsupervised Learning: Here, there are no labels. The computer is just given a pile of data and asked to find patterns or groups on its own. It’s useful for things like customer segmentation or finding anomalies in credit card transactions.

Reinforcement Learning: This is based on trial and error. An agent performs an action in an environment and gets a "reward" for good moves and a "penalty" for bad ones. It’s how AI learns to play games like Chess or Go.
