# Day 1: Linear Regression
What it is: Linear Regression is used to predict a continuous numerical value.
It assumes there is a direct, straight-line relationship between your input (Independent Variable) and your output (Dependent Variable).
  
In simple terms, it tries to draw the "best fit" line through a bunch of data points so that the distance between the line and the actual points is as small as possible.
The Core Formula: 
Similar to the equation for a line: y=mx+c. In ML y=wX+b, 
  where y: The prediction (Target)
  X:The input (feature)
  w:The weight (how much X affects y)
  b:The bias (the starting point/intercept)
